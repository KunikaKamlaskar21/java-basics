constructors in java:

constructor is a special method used to initialize the object.
user need not to write constructor, if the constructor is not defined, java will create one for user.
we can give initial values to attributes in constructor.
constructors can be parameterized.
we can pass the values to constructors using parameters.



Note:

constructor must have same name as class name.
it must not have any return type.
constructor is called when the object is created.


Code:
public class Main{
    public Main(){
        System.out.println("This is constructor from Main class");
    }
    
    public static void myMethod(){
        System.out.println("This is method");
    } 
    
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Main m= new Main();
        
        myMethod();
    }
    
}

output:
This is constructor from Main class
This is method
