what is classes and objects?

class is a template for an object.
Object is a instance of class.

for example: if mobile is class, then types of mobiles or brands of mobiles is object.
like we say screen touch phones is class, then redMi, Samsung, etc is object.

code:


public class Main
{
    String mobile1= "RedMi";
    String mobile2= "Samsung";
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Objects of class");
		Main m = new Main();
		System.out.println(m.mobile1);
		System.out.println(m.mobile2);
	}
}
